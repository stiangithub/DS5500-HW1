## Problem 1
I got 62% right answers. I'm surprised by question 7: The United Nations predicts that by 2100 the world population will have increased by another 4 billion people. What is the main reason? The right answer is "there will be more adults". I thought that in developed countries, more and more aging population is a critical problem. Meanwhile in some African countries, more and more children for poor family is also a problem.

I will change the question related to epidemic to "What is the trend of number of death caused by epidemic?"

From the plot you can see, from 1970 to 1983, number of deaths caused by epidemic remains at a stable level with a slight growth trend. From 1983 to 1997, this number becomes really unstable: there are 3 peaks of number of death in 1988, 1991 and 1996 respectively, which indicates 5 massive epidemics (2 in 1991 and 2 in 1996) in history: 1988 Ethiopia meningococcal meningitis outbreak, 1991 Peru cholera outbreak & 1991 Nigeria cholera outbreak, and 1996 Nigeria & Burkina Faso meningococcal meningitis. The 1991 Peru cholera outbreak is one of the most destructive epidemic activity in modern history. Cholera is highly vulnerable in some third-world countries since their widespread lack of clean drinking water and proper sewage disposal.

## Problem 2

The above plot shows how each year's world's total income per capita(combining all countries) changes. Generally speaking, world's total income is growing since 1800, and the growth becomes really fast after 1950. You can see before 1950, the world's total income (or we can say world's average income, the trend is same) is growing very slowly because of reasons like low level of production and world wars. But then after (which is WW2 ends), world's total income has a significant growth, which means for this world, we have a window of 25 years to develope our economic. Then we hit the 1973-1975 recession, which slow down the growth of income. After that, with similar growth rate compared with 1950-1975, world's income meets its second explosive growth, until the 2009 Great Recession. Also the data gives the prediction about the income till 2040. The expectation is that the income will still grow with similar rate.

However, I also plot the income situation for 5 countries which has the least income in 2018. You can see in the golden age of income boosting (1950-2000), their income, rather than growing, drops dramatically. After year 2000, their income level remains the same (not see much growth). So my caveats is that for low income countries, it's difficult for them to catch up the world's growing trend in income, which may lead to increase the gap between the rich country and the poor country.

## Problem 3

The above are three plots about average income, life expectancy, and child mortality over time for each continent. Generally speaking, since 1800, world's income and life expectancy has continuously improving, while child mortality has continuous decreasing. I want to split this period into 3 parts: before 1900, 1900-1950, after 1950.

For the part before 1900, because the human production level is low, the income level and life expectancy remains low and shows little improvement and child mortality remains high for 100 years. But things are different for Europe from 1870-1900. Because the second industrial revolution and several scientific achievements, Europe shows noticeable improvement in income and life expectancy and decreasing child mortality.

For 1900-1950, human production level begins to increase, which leads to world wide income and life expectancy improving and child mortality decreasing. However, there is a spike for life expectancy in this period. This is caused by two world wars, which are horrible disasters for human.

After 1950, this world meets an peaceful period for fast developing. With the production level increases and world war ends, the world shows a trend of improving income and life expectancy, and decreasing child mortality in general. Also the increasing & decreasing rate is higher than before.

There are some big gaps in these plots, which are caused by missing data.

## Problem 4
I will choose new born mortality rate and HDI (Human Development Index)to see their relation ship after year 2000. My intution is that higher HDI leads to lower new born mortality rate.

![hw1_problem3](https://github.com/stiangithub/DS5500-HW1/blob/master/hw1_problem4_1.png)

![hw1_problem3](https://github.com/stiangithub/DS5500-HW1/blob/master/hw1_problem4_2.png)

So from the above two plots, we can see after year 2000, this world's average HDI is increasing at a fixed rate, while new born mortality rate is decreasing at a fixed rate. So they are negatively related.

## Problem 5
I use static plots. 

### Advantages of using interactive visualization: 
There are two reasons that why interactive visualization is prefered: the huge volume of historical data and data fast updating. So for huge volume of historical data, it is not difficult to put them into one/several static plots, however, it will be extremely difficult for readers to find useful information. Interactive visualization fixes this problem by providing a dynamic visualization environment. Users can choose (interact) what they want to see. Another reason is that data get updated every day. So by using interactive visualization, like interacting with the data to put focus on specific metrics, users are able to compare specific throughout definable timeframes, identifying cause-and-effect relationships that would otherwise likely be overlooked.

Also, the goal of visualization is to tell a story. We like to see how things develop and progress across time. I believe interactive visualization is a better storyteller.

### Disadvantages of using interactive visualization:
A big disadvantage comes into my mind is building interactive visualization cost more time. Sometimes people just want to see a direct and clean representation of something quickly. Rather than spending lots of time producting a fancy interactive visualization, a simple static plot would help more.
