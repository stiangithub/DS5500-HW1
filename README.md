## Problem 1
I got 62% right answers. I'm surprised by question 7: The United Nations predicts that by 2100 the world population will have increased by another 4 billion people. What is the main reason? The right answer is "there will be more adults". I thought that in developed countries, more and more aging population is a critical problem. Meanwhile in some African countries, more and more children for poor family is also a problem.

I will change the question related to epidemic to "What is the trend of number of death caused by epidemic?"

From the plot you can see, from 1970 to 1983, number of deaths caused by epidemic remains at a stable level with a slight growth trend. From 1983 to 1997, this number becomes really unstable: there are 3 peaks of number of death in 1988, 1991 and 1996 respectively, which indicates 5 massive epidemics (2 in 1991 and 2 in 1996) in history: 1988 Ethiopia meningococcal meningitis outbreak, 1991 Peru cholera outbreak & 1991 Nigeria cholera outbreak, and 1996 Nigeria & Burkina Faso meningococcal meningitis. The 1991 Peru cholera outbreak is one of the most destructive epidemic activity in modern history. Cholera is highly vulnerable in some third-world countries since their widespread lack of clean drinking water and proper sewage disposal.
